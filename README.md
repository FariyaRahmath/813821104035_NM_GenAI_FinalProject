The ipynb file consists of the project.
I have used the "Churn_Modeling" dataset from Kaggle to build the model.
I have created an ANN model and trained, tested and validated it.
I created my own "FinalTest" dataset to test the model on unseen data.
I have also performed data visualization.
I have plotted the loss and accuracy factors of the ANN model built.
The PPT file consists of the overview of my project.
